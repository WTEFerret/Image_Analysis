# 1. Single Cells

For single cell analysis we have two workflows. The older one uses Ilastik for the segmentation  and FIJI/ImageJ for further analysis.
The newer workflow mostly uses DeLTA and also includes the tracking of single cells over time.

## Ilastik and FIJI
[Ilastik](https://www.ilastik.org/) can be obtained on their website and detailed usage instructions can be found in the [documentation](https://www.ilastik.org/documentation/).

## DeLTA
Detailed information on DeLTA can be found in the [original publication](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009797) , as well as on the [repository](https://gitlab.com/delta-microscopy/delta) and the [documentation](https://delta.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
